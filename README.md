# challenge-9-readme-generator
readme generator 
This program generates a quick and easy readme for the busy programmer. I was motivated to do this because I wanted to know if I understood node and the lessons we'd had previously and wanted to test myself. 
I built this project because  wanted a way to build readme's quickly because I usually always program things at the last moment.
The problem it solves is generating readme's quickly
I learned a lot about node and backend programming.
